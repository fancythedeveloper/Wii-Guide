##### Section II - Triggering the Exploit

1. Go to the `Internet` section, then `User Agreements` or `Agreement/Contact`, then `Yes`.
1. If you see a pony on the screen on a light blue background, you have set it up correctly. Wait 1-2 minutes for the exploit to trigger (it should take about 1 minute and 25 seconds). The exploit will download the HackMii Installer so you can continue.

If the HackMii Installer doesn't load and it instead freezes (you can't move your cursor) or it doesn't take 1-2 minutes to trigger, please restart your Wii and retry the exploit.
