![BootMii Logo](/images/bootmii.png)

One of BootMii's most important features is the ability to backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage. We will be going over how to perform a NAND backup. You can then restore from that backup for whatever reason. We recommend making a NAND backup regularly or before you do something risky to your console (and if you know what you're doing, you won't have to do anything risky).

#### What you need

* An SD card with at least 512MB of free space

#### Instructions

In order to navigate BootMii, you have to use the buttons on your actual Wii console (or a GameCube Controller in port 1). You cannot use a Wii Remote.<br>
To navigate between options, press the POWER Button on your Wii (or the right +Control Pad button on a GameCube controller).<br>
To select an option, press the RESET Button on your Wii (or the A button on a GameCube controller).<br>
You can navigate left or right with a GameCube controller, with the buttons on your Wii you can only navigate right.

Don't worry when "bad blocks" are detected on a NAND backup. These are completely normal.

Do not turn off your Wii when backing up your NAND!
{: .notice--warning}

1. Launch the Homebrew Channel.
2. Press the HOME Button, then select "Launch BootMii".
3. Press the Options button (the one with the gears).
4. Press the BackupMii button (the one with the green arrow).
5. A NAND backup will start. You can watch the progress on the screen.
6. When it's done backing up, it will verify the backup. It can be skipped by pressing the EJECT button if you want, but we recommend to keep it running.
7. When the backup is fully complete, exit the NAND backup screen by pressing any button. To get out of BootMii, press the Back button (the one with the arrow) and then you can press either the Wii Menu button or the Homebrew Channel button to exit where you want to.

To restore from a NAND backup on your SD card, you can follow these instructions using RestoreMii (the button right next to BackupMii with a red arrow).

Priiloader adds a level of brick protection, and we recommend it, especially if you only installed BootMii as an IOS.
